              I am Bharat Rana, originally from Amritsar, Punjab, with 2 years
              of experience as a software engineer. My expertise lies in
              frontend development using technologies like React.js, Next.js,
              HTML/CSS, Tailwind CSS, and Material-UI. On the backend, I have
              proficiency in Node.js, Express.js, Redis, MongoDB, and MySQL. I
              also have experience with AWS services (S3, SNS, SQS, Lambda),
              Docker, Kafka, Git, Github, Socket.io, and WebRTC.

            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              For the assignment, I utilized technologies such as Redux for
              state management, React.js for frontend development, and Material-UI
              for UI components. The project included creating dynamic UIs,
              handling API calls, and integrating components effectively using
              modern frontend practices. This setup ensured a scalable and
              efficient solution for managing and displaying food-related data
              fetched from external APIs.
